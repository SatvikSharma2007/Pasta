To keep pasta from sticking, stir it gently in the beginning. You can also add a pinch of salt. Salt helps in making the surface rough so that it doesn't stick. It is suggested to cook your pasta just a tad more than al dente (bite-like). Avoid rinsing the pasta, after it is cooked. Place it in a colander and let the excess water drain. Rinsing may wash away all the flavour. You can even make pasta from scratch. Here's a simple recipe - Pasta Dough.
